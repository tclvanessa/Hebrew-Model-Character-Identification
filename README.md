# Hebrew Model Character Identification Project
### Overview
This project, developed by a team of four, aims to create a machine learning model for identifying Hebrew characters in images. The model is designed to take images of Hebrew characters as input and classify them into their respective character classes. The project includes data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation.

### Project Structure
Dataset: The dataset consists of images containing Hebrew characters. It is divided into training and testing sets.

Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing involves tasks such as resizing images, converting them to tensors, and normalizing pixel values. A custom dataset class is used to handle data loading and transformations.

Model Architecture: The model architecture is designed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The architecture includes convolutional layers, batch normalization, ReLU activation functions, and fully connected layers. The goal is to learn meaningful features from the input images.

Training: The model is trained using the training dataset. The training process involves forward and backward passes, optimization, and loss calculation. The project employs techniques such as data augmentation and learning rate scheduling for improved training performance.

Evaluation: Model evaluation is performed using the testing dataset. Metrics such as accuracy are calculated to assess the model's performance in identifying Hebrew characters.

### Dependencies
- PyTorch: Used for building and training neural networks.
- torchvision: Provides tools for working with image data.
- PIL (Python Imaging Library): Used for image processing.
- matplotlib: Used for data visualization.

### Usage
1. Data Preparation: Organize the dataset into appropriate training and testing folders.

2. Data Loading: Define a custom dataset class to load and preprocess the data. Specify transformations such as resizing and normalization.

3. Model Definition: Create a CNN-based model for Hebrew character identification. Define the architecture, loss criterion, and optimizer.

4. Training: Train the model using the training dataset. Monitor training progress and adjust hyperparameters as necessary.

5. Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on the testing dataset to assess its accuracy and performance.
   
### Conclusion 
The Hebrew Model Character Identification Project aims to develop a machine learning solution for recognizing Hebrew characters in images.
